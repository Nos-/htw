\begin{enumerate}
\item Pull the headset down until your eyes are on the same level with the lenses.
\item Slide the head belt to the back of your head and fasten it so that it fits well. Make sure it is not too tight.
\item Afterwards regularly check the headset’s fit so that you feel well while playing.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Managing the Neuro-Stimulators}

When you put the headset on for the first time to play, a window will show up and ask you whether you want to turn the stimulators on. Choose 'Yes' or 'No'.

When you turn them on you will experience dizziness and lightheadedness for approximately 5 seconds. \medskip\\
Warning: If you feel dizzy or uncomfortable for a longer period of time, turn the Neuro-Stimulators immediately off by pressing the red button (No. 3) on the right side of the headset.

\item	Plug the power cable into the charging port (No. 5) and then the other side of the cable to a power source. 
\item	Insert the USB cable on the right USB port of your computer.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Cleaning the Headset and Lenses}

\subsection*{The Headset}
\begin{itemize}
\item Wet the cleaning cloth that comes in the package with water to wipe the headset and lenses clean. Do not use any other cleaning liquid. Other liquids may cause damage to the headset.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Lenses}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use the same cleaning cloth provided in the package
\item Wet the cloth with a lens cleaner or similar cleaning liquid.

\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Visit our Website pokémonreality.com to download the Pokémon setup software. 

Note: you need to register on our page before you can download the software. Please use the username and password provided in the package.
\item Make sure you have an internet connection before you start with the installation. The setup wizard will guide through the installation step by step so that you do not make any mistake. 
\item Launch the Pokémon setup wizard and then click 'next'.
\item Click 'install' to go ahead with the installation.
\item After the installation is finished please restart your computer. 
\item Run Pokémon Reality after the restart.
\item A window will pop up asking you whether you want to use the Neuro-Stimulators. Please read the instructions given in 7. Managing the Neuro-Stimulators.
\item Before you can start playing there is one more step you must follow: calibration your IPD.  Please follow the steps below.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Calibrating the interpupillary distance (IPD)}

Everyone has a differently shaped head. To have the best experience it is necessary that the shift in the game corresponds to the shift in the real world. That is why we must know your interpupillary distance. 

Interpupillary distance (IPD) is the distance between the center of the pupils of the two eyes.

The Pokémon Gear has a Calibration setting for you to measure your IPD without the help of an optician. Follow the steps below after you have worn and turned the headset on:

\caption[Configuring the \emph{\pokeT{} reality gear} software]{Configuring the \emph{\poke{} reality gear} software}
\label{gear_ipd}
\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Go to the main menu, click 'vr\_calibration' and then Enter. The calibration screen will open and a piece of text will appear in front of you.
\item After 3 seconds a horizontal line with an arrow on it will appear below the text. Choose the best calibration option by dragging the arrow on the line so that the text in front of you is as sharp as possible. 
\item Follow this procedure twice for both eyes.
\item After you have followed the procedure click 'Close'.
\item The measured IPD will automatically be saved for further use.
\item Now that the IPD has been measured you can immerse into the Pokémon world!
\end{enumerate}
