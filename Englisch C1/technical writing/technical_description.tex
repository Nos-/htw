\emph{\poke{} reality: the game} is generally suitable for all ages. It contains minimal mild cartoon violence and some mild language.

It is recommended to pause playing the game every hour for at least five minutes. This ensures minimal disorientation after long game sessions.

\section{Scope Of The Game}

The main focus of \emph{\poke{} reality: the game} is the exploration of the game world and the encounters with all kinds of \poke{}. In contrast to previous installments of \poke{} games, \emph{\poke{} reality: the game} lets you chose what regions you want to explore and what \poke{} you want to encounter.

\label{pokemap}
\end{figure}

The \poke{} world is composed of all your favorite regions of the previous games. The following regions are open for you to explore (see Figure \ref{pokemap}):
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Kanto
\item Johto
\item Hoenn
\item Sinnoh
\item Unova
\item Kalos
\item Alma
\item Orre
\item Oblivia
\item Fiore
\item Orange Islands
\item Sevii Islands
\end{itemize} 
\end{multicols}

All these regions carry unique bioms and moods. There are different kinds of towns and landscapes to explore: From the windy \emph{Orange Islands} with their gusting sea to the steep mountains in the west of \emph{Kanto}.

One of the most important feature of \emph{\poke{} reality: the game} is the fact, that you may pick what \poke{} you want to encounter. 

You want a more retrospective experience? No problem: just deactivate all \poke{} except the first generation and you will only encounter \emph{Kanto-\poke{}}.

You want the full experience? Just keep the settings unchanged and get to know the whole range of \poke{}.

You may choose among the following sets of \poke{}, together over 800 \poke{}:
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\item 1. Generation: 151 \emph{Kanto}-\poke{}
\item 2. Generation: 100 \emph{Johto}-\poke{}
\item 3. Generation: 135 \emph{Hoenn}-\poke{}
\item 4. Generation: 107 \emph{Sinnoh}-\poke{}
\item 5. Generation: 156 \emph{Einall}-\poke{}
\item 6. Generation: 72 \emph{Kalos}-\poke{}
\item 7. Generation: 79 \emph{Alola}-\poke{}
\item[]
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
