\emph{\poke{} reality: the game} is generally suitable for all ages. It contains minimal mild cartoon violence and some mild language.

It is recommended to pause playing the game every hour for at least five minutes. This ensures minimal disorientation after long game sessions.

\section{Scope Of The Game}

The main focus of \emph{\poke{} reality: the game} is the exploration of the game world and the encounters with all kinds of \poke{}. In contrast to previous installments of \poke{} games, \emph{\poke{} reality: the game} lets you chose what regions you want to explore and what \poke{} you want to encounter.

\caption[The \emph{\pokeT{} reality game} map with all available 'regions']{The \emph{\poke{} reality game} map with all available 'regions'}
\label{pokemap}
\end{figure}

The \poke{} world is composed of all your favorite regions of the previous games. The following regions are open for you to explore (see Figure \ref{pokemap}):
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Kanto
\item Johto
\item Hoenn
\item Sinnoh
\item Unova
\item Kalos
\item Alma
\item Orre
\item Oblivia
\item Fiore
\item Orange Islands
\item Sevii Islands
\end{itemize} 
\end{multicols}

All these regions carry unique bioms and moods. There are different kinds of towns and landscapes to explore: From the windy \emph{Orange Islands} with their gusting sea to the steep mountains in the west of \emph{Kanto}.

One of the most important feature of \emph{\poke{} reality: the game} is the fact, that you may pick what \poke{} you want to encounter. 

You want a more retrospective experience? No problem: just deactivate all \poke{} except the first generation and you will only encounter \emph{Kanto-\poke{}}.

You want the full experience? Just keep the settings unchanged and get to know the whole range of \poke{}.

You may choose among the following sets of \poke{}, together over 800 \poke{}:
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\item 1. Generation: 151 \emph{Kanto-\pokeT}
\item 2. Generation: 100 \emph{Johto-\pokeT}
\item 3. Generation: 135 \emph{Hoenn-\pokeT}
\item 4. Generation: 107 \emph{Sinnoh-\pokeT}
\item 5. Generation: 156 \emph{Einall-\pokeT}
\item 6. Generation: 72 \emph{Kalos-\pokeT}
\item 7. Generation: 79 \emph{Alola-\pokeT}
\item[]
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\section{Gameplay}

The gameplay consists mainly of three parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item exploring the world
\item fighting and catching new \poke{}
\item battling \poke{}-trainers
\end{itemize}

The final goal in the game is to catch as many \poke{} as you can, become the best \poke{}-trainer and find all the secrets hidden in the world.

\subsection{Exploration}

As you will playing the game with your \emph{\poke{} reality gear}, the exploring itself is pretty much how you explore the real world, too: Walk and wonder (Figure \ref{exploration}).

\end{center}

\end{figure}

By keeping an eye open for details, you may discover hidden paths which lead to secret areas. There you may find rare \poke{} and unique items (Figure \ref{secrets}).

\end{figure}

You can manage the following in the game menu:
\begin{itemize}
\item caught \poke{}
\item found secrets
\item your game progress
\end{itemize}
This menu is used intuitively with your \emph{\poke{} reality gear} (Figure \ref{menu}).

\subsection[\pokeT{}-battles]{\poke{}\,-battles}
During your exploration of the \poke{} world, you will encounter random \poke{} in the wild. In populated areas you may find other \poke{}-trainers (NPC). Both lead to \poke{} battles between you and your opponent.

A battle has the following sequence of events:
\begin{enumerate}
\item You choose a \poke{} to battle the opponent.
\item The battle proceeds turn-based. In one turn each you may take one of the following actions:
\begin{itemize}
\item choose an offensive or defensive action for your \poke{} to execute
\item use a special item from the inventory to buff the fighting \poke{}
\item exchange the fighting \poke{} for a different \poke{} from your team
\item retreat from the battle
\end{itemize}
\item These turns are repeated until the fight is over. If you lose you will be teleported back to the nearest town. By winning your \poke{} gain experience and you may get some item-rewards.
\end{enumerate}

%\newpage
In Figure \ref{battle} you can see the layout of a battle:
\begin{itemize}
\item Your \poke{} is at the bottom left with the corresponding name and its HP on the right.
\item Your opponent is at the top: the name and HP at the top left and the \poke{} on the right.
\end{itemize}

\subsection[Catching \pokeT{}]{Catching \poke{}}
During battles with wild \poke{} you have the chance to catch them to add to your team. This takes place during one of your turns: Instead of attacking the opponent, you select a Pokéball from your inventory (Figure \ref{catching}). With some luck, this results in the \poke{} being caught by you. To increase your chances, it is recommended to weaken the \poke{} you are trying to catch before using a Pokéball by attacking it and thus reducing its HP.
